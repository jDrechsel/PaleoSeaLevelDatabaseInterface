# PaleoSeaLevelDatabaseInterface

Software development Project to provide data management structure for field data with
extensive metadata. This software was developed for the PALSEA template data structure,
however it can serve as a prototype to handle other georeferenced point datasets and help to
establish data standards. Using Open Source materials allows the software to be platform
independent, modifiable and integrated into other frameworks.
